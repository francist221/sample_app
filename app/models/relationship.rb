class Relationship < ActiveRecord::Base
  attr_accessible :followed_id

  #we define the belongs_to relationship as usual. Rails infers the names of the foreign keys from the corresponding symbols (i.e., follower_id from :follower, and followed_id from :followed), but since there is neither a Followed nor a Follower model we need to supply the class name User.
  belongs_to :follower, :class_name => "User"
  belongs_to :followed, :class_name => "User"

  validates :follower_id, :presence => true
  validates :followed_id, :presence => true
